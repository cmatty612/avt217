    <ol>
    <li> <b> What do you want to be called? </b> </li>
    <br> I like to be called Christina
    <br>
    <br/>
    <li> <b> Where are you from? </b> </li>
    <br> Richmond, Virginia.
    <br>
    <br/>

    <li> <b> Where do you live now? </b>  </li>
    <br> I live in an on campus apartment.
    <br>
    <br/>
    <li> <b> What did you do over winter break? </b> </li>
    <br> For the majority of my break, I just blobbed around the house.
    Then I went on a spontaneous trip to Europe, because I found a ridiculoudly cheap flight,
    and figured that this winter break would be the last significant chunk of time that
    I have before I start working 40 hours a week. I visited Budapest, Vienna, Prague, and London, over 10 days.
    I had so much fun, and met so many cool people.
    <br>
    <br/>

    <li> <b> What is one of your favorite movies? </b> </li>
    <br> <i> Bridget Jones' Diary </i> is one of my favorite movies
    <br>
    <br/>
    <li> <b> What is your favorite game? </b> </li>
    <br> I am not a gamer, but I enjoy the card game Rummy.
    <br>
    <br/>
    <li> <b> What is your least favorite color? </b> </li>
    <br> My least favorite color is dark brown - like those dark brown cabinets that some people have in their kitchens.
    I feel this way because it's a difficult color to match, and if it's dark enough, it can just be confused for black.
    <br>
    <br/>
    <li> <b> What is the last book you read? </b> </li>
    <br> <i> A Casual Vacancy </i> -- that book that J.K. Rowling wrote under a pseudonym
    <br>
    <br/>
    <li> <b> Why are you taking this class? </b> </li>
    <br> I am taking this class because I think it would be useful -- I am a Communications major
    with a concentration in Media Production and Criticism, and I think that web design falls under
    the production portion of my degree. I am also attracted to the idea that web designers can work from anywhere;
    it is my ambition to do a lot of traveling while I am young, so I am eager to learn skills that would allow me to make money anywhere.
    <br>
    <br/>
    <li> <b> Would you rather fight one hundred
      sized horses or one horse sized duck? </b> </li>
      <br>
      I'd rather fight one horse sized duck, because there is only one. That way I wouldn't have to be too overwhelmed and could concentrate my efforts.
      <br/>
