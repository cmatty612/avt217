         What makes cake so delicious?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Oil -Provides a velvety smooth texture, adds moisture and crumb appeal. We use soybean oil, which has zero grams of trans fat.Eggs - Eggs provide proteins and protein is what gives our cake its volume, height, structure and contributes to crumb appeal. When we use egg whites or whole eggs (ultra pasteurized liquid eggs), the pasteurization process ensures the eggs we use are always consistent in protein content and far superior to even some fresh eggs, which can vary in size, therefore affecting the protein content.Flavorings & Extracts - They provide the perfect combination for a rich, deep flavor profile. We use natural and artificial vanilla extract and almond emulsion. In the right proportion the two flavors marry together perfectly. Too much almond will make it bitter, not enough vanilla and it will be bland.

        Ultimately you are the one paying for and providing the cake for your guests. You have spent time, and maybe a few extra pounds, tasting and deciding which flavors tickle your taste buds. You want your specialty cake to be a flavor combination that you love and enjoy. There is no need to sweat the small stuff because honestly, if you love your cake, your guests will too. Choosing the right flavor for your custom cake doesnâ€™t have to be stressful.
